Description: High performance MySQL proxy
 ProxySQL is a fast, reliable MySQL proxy with advanced runtime configuration management (virtually no configuration change requires a restart).
 It features query routing, query caching, query rewriting (for queries generated by ORMs, for example) and is most of the time a drop-in replacement for mysqld from the point of view of the application. It can be configured and remote controlled through an SQL-compatible admin interface.

### Uninstalling packages 

The `apt remove` removes the packages. Any configuration files, data, and dependencies remain in the system. If you reinstall *ProxySQL 2.x.x*, the software uses the same configuration files, data, and dependencies. The reinstallation may ask to override the existing files.

You can uninstall `ProxySQL 2.x.x` with the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt remove proxysql2
```

The `apt purge` removes the packages and any configuration files and data. You can also use `apt purge` to remove packages for an uninstalled application.

```shell
$ sudo apt purge proxysql2
```

The `apt autoremove` removes the packages, configuration files, data, and any unused libraries or dependent packages that were installed when the application was installed.

To remove them, run the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt autoremove
```
