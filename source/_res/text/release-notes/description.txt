|proxysql| |release|, released by ProxySQL_, is now available for download in
the `Percona repository`_ along with an updated version of |percona|’s
|command.proxysql-admin| tool.

|proxysql| is a high-performance proxy, currently for |mysql|, and database
servers in the |mysql| ecosystem (like |ps| and |mariadb|). It acts as an
intermediary for client requests seeking resources from the
database. |proxysql-author| created |proxysql| for DBAs as a means of solving
complex replication topology issues.

The |proxysql| |release| source and binary packages available from the `Percona
download page for ProxySQL 2.0`_ include |proxysql-admin| – a tool developed by
|percona| to configure |pxc| nodes into |proxysql|. |docker| images for release
|release| are available as well. You can `download the original ProxySQL from
GitHub`_. |github| offers the `ProxySQL documentation in the wiki format`_.
